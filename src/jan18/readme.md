##  Recap

Has - a relationship--- aggregation

is - a relationship---- inheritance


Aggregation-- like employee has an address

Aggregation is used when no is a relationship is used only has a relationship is used 
and aggregation is used for code reusability 

## Abstraction

showing only the essential features and hiding the complex details

1. abstraction class[0-100%]
2. interfaces [100%]

how to make a class an abstract class?
with the use of abstract keyword

.an abstract can have abstract or non-abstract methods
.abstract method does not have body or implementation body
.if a class has an abstract method, class must be abstract
.You cannot create an object of abstract class cannot instantiate 
the abstract class.



## interfaces

What is interface?
-template
-similar to the class
-it has constants
-all methods are abstract
-100% of abstraction
-multiple inheritance

it's a contract which every class have to fulfil, whoever is going to inherit from it.

how to declare interface?

interface Test {            //similiar to class


public, static and  final   // all the variable, fields are by default


public and abstract        // all the methods are by default and nonabstract is used in interfaces

You cannot create an object or instantiate the interface.
