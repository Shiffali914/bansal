## Set
-It does not allow duplicate elements 
-Only one null element is allowed
-it is in random order
-internally hashSet is backed by hashMap



1.HashSet---- Random order and unique

2.TreeSet---- Ascending order/natural sorting order
              treeSet cann't allow null elements

3.LinkedHashSet---- Insertion order

difference between floor and ceiling in treeSet functions

ceiling---- return the highest or equal

floor--- returns the small element or equal and null value return if there is no element in the Set.

Lower---it will return the greater than or small value but in equal value it will null value

poll first- it will remove the first element from set

poll last-- it will remove the last element from set
