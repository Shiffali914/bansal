## Exception
which breaks normal flow of execution

## Exception Handling
handle the program gracefully

try catch
throw vs throw
final finalize

## FINALLY
finally block will execute always
no matter if the exception is caught or not
closing the resources/close the database connection

except one scenario
when we use system.exit(0); because it exit the program already then final block is not executed in that case.
infinite loop in catch and try

DB------>source
Scanner----> some exception occupied


##### Important difference

throw-you create your own exception for particular scenario
throws-you throw this exception for someone else call method has to handle this exception

final vs finally vs finalize

final-- it is used when variable is constant and it is used in method which is not overridden
finally-it is used whether exception is occured or not
finalize-it is used for garbage collections.
